				This visualisation was written by Joshua Hollick using data from <a href="https://espace.curtin.edu.au/">Curtin's eSpace</a>. Thanks to Janice Chan and Daniel Piczak for access to data and the original idea.
			</p>
			<p>
				For more details please see the paper:<br>
				&emsp;Joshua Hollick, Pauline Joseph, Peter Green, Janice Chan, "Research network visualisation of co-authorship at Curtin" (in preparation).
			</p>
			<p>
				This visualisation shows coauthorship within Curtin University. Each node is a person, links are created between people that have coauthored a paper. The strength of these links is proportional to the number of papers coauthored.
			</p>
			Controls are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Use the mouse and WASD to look/move around, Hold shift to speed up movement.</li>
				<li>Q & E rotate the screen anticlockwise and clockwise respectively.</li>
				<li>1-5 enable/disable faculties</li>
				<li>I, O, P show colouring based on different things</li>
				<ul>
					<li>I - Faculty Colours</li>
					<li>O - Degree Centrality, shows nodes and links that have lots of connections</li>
					<li>P - Betweenness Centrality, essentially shows the most important nodes and links based on the whole graph connectivity.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Press 'R' to start/stop the charge spring model (works like play/pause)</li>
				<li>"Reset State" resets to the default. This doesn't overwrite your previous save so to go back just exit and restart to restore.</li>
			</ul>
				<p>
				<b>Important Note</b>: The data contained in this visualisation is from a limited period and may be incomplete. While the values shown are indicitive they should not be taken as a true representation of research output without further investigation.
